# Yaesu-FT-840-CAT-

Frontend application with installer package to control via RS-232 the Yaesu FT-840 transceiver

This application for the remote control and operation of the Yaesu FT-840 transceiver was developed in year 2001 with Visual Basic 6.0. 
It requires a serial port to TTL interface like the MAX232. 

After installation please select an available serial port. 

I don`t tested the application with a USB to serial cable but I think it would work because the drivers are PNP compatible with RS-232 standards.

In the files there is a schematoic of the TTL to RS232 interface using the MAX 232 chip.
